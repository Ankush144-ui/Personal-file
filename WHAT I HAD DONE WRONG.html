        <h1><b><em>THE WRONG DECISIONS</em></b></h1>
        <hr size="3" noshade>
        <h2><u>Listening to others:</u></h2>One of the biggest mistakes i had done was always listening 
        to others for my future decisions. When I completed my 12th grade i was just listening to others 
        about what should I do and i never considered what i like to do or what is the most practical way
        for earning. That was one of the main fault of mine at that time.
        <h2><u>Peer Pressure:</u></h2>It's one of the main reason for most of the people for having wrong 
        decisions in life. Many of us choose the wrong college and field just because our friends are doing 
        it. But after sometime when they see that this course wasn't meant for them it was already too late 
        according to them and they can't drop out because they thought all the money would go to waste. It
        led to a long term problem in their life.
        <h2><u>No Knowledge:</u></h2>Even though I had made a decision that i don't want to do college I 
        never have the idea what else i would do or how will i do it. If you think just by thinking it would 
        help you to succed in life then my friend you are purely mistaken. It would also be hard for you to 
        walk on the path you choosed for yourself just because you dont have any knowledge for that thing.
        <h2><u>Getting Delusional:</u></h2>I was delusioned that i am the best and i know everything about 
        the world. But I was wrong because I don't even have a common knowledge about the world and i don't 
        even know what is good for me. That mindset was like a slow poison because it was making me lazy and 
        arrogant. That's one of the main problem in our generation because we all love to live in our fantasies 
        and think that we are the only one and the strongest of all in this world. The faster the pearson snap 
        out his delusion and try to live in the reality the more he will realize that how wrong he was and how 
        hard it is to face all the challenges and rejections of this real world.
        <h2><u>Overconfidence:</u></h2>It is one of the most common reason that people tend to fail in common 
        things. It is because they always become overconfident in their ability to do task. This only led to 
        the getting the task wrongly done and messing up the whole thing. The faster the people realize their 
        potential and ability to do work the best it will be for them. Because only when you know your limit
        after that you can work on that to increase it or to improve the quality of it. 
        <h2><u>Wrong Advice:</u></h2>Most of us tend to take advice from others for our future decisions. But 
        there is one thing we all forget that is if that person is expert or doing work in that field which 
        advice he or she is giving. As a example when i completed my 12th grade i asked for advice from so many 
        teachers and other people. All of them told me to do college,get a degree & get a job. But every time 
        when i say that i want to learn about trading,stock marketing and web development they all laugh at me 
        and told me to not be delusional and just do what they have done. It strongly affected my decision making.
        So my advice for all of you is that if you are doing a certain thing take advice from someone from that 
        field and don't go to random people because they haven't done that thing and can't tell you about that.
        Most of the time they will make fun of you which will affect you in a bad way.

        <h3><b>You will face many difficulties in the life and also many people are going to mock you. But if 
            you believe in yourself and keep doing the work which is necessary for you to do in order to achieve
            a certain goal my advice for you is to keep grinding and keep on doing the work because that is the 
            only thing you know that you can do and don't give up early. Yes,you will find many problems doing 
            your work but remember if that was easy everbody would have done it there is a reson people are 
            afraid to do that it's because it is hard to do. I hope you best of luck for whatever you are doing 
            in any field and keep on grinding because hard work is the only way to success in life.</b></h3>
