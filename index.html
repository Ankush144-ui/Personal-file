    <h1>Ankush Sharma</h1>
    <p><em><strong>Self Learning Student</strong></em></p>
    <p>I am a college dropout and just started learning web development.
        I am not so sure about my decision but this seems more practical
        then spending my 3 to 4 years of my life in a place which is not
        profitable anymore and doing the things which won't help me making
        money. So here i am now after spending about a year and half in a 
        worthless college doing what i should have a done a long time ago.

     <h3>Education</h3>
     <p>The highest level of education i have is high school pass out.I have
        done my schooling from CBSE board from <STRONG>ARMY SCHOOL</STRONG>.
        During my school time i got to know a couple of good teachers but most
        of my teachers were not so good.I have learnt there that if i want
        to be succesfull in my life I don't need any degree or education. The
        thing i need the most was the knowledge and experience. These 2 things
        I considered the best for me if I want to do anything in my life.

    <h3>MY Time Table</h3>Now this is a time table i made for myself as i am
    learning trading also. So it's a simple time table i came up with to help 
    me go through the day without compromising anything.   
    <br>
    <br>
    <table cellspacing="20">
        <tr>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>Work</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5am-6am</td>
            <td>waking up,brush,getting fresh</td>
        </tr>    
        <tr>
            <td>6am-8am</td>
            <td>jogging,exercise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>8am-10am</td>
            <td>shower,breakfast,news</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>    
            <td>10am-1pm</td>
            <td>Studying trading</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1pm-4pm</td>
            <td>Lunch,break,nap</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4pm-6pm</td>
            <td>gym</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6pm-7pm</td>
            <td>shower,rest,coffee</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>    
            <td>7pm-9pm</td>
            <td>Web development classes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>    
            <td>9pm-10pm</td>
            <td>Dinner</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>    
            <td>10pm-11pm</td>
            <td>Working on my website</td>
        </tr>    
        <tr>
            <td>11pm-5am</td>
            <td>Sleep</td>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>Acoording to this time table i get to do most of my things done and i dont
        even have to compromise with my health. But this is just for the starting
        as i go into more and more deep in the studying of web development and trading
        the rest hours will be converted into working hours but for starting this is 
        good enough to follow and help you maintain a pace.
