        <em>I believe that if you are here reading this you had already read the things 
            which i had done wrong in the previous link. The reason i am writing this in 
            another page is because many people will be bored after seeing a long page.
            So as i was saying that i had done many mistakes in the past and to correct 
            those i had also taken many decisions for myself.
            <p>
                Right now i am also in the process of improving my skills and as you know this is 
                my first website. I just want to help you in some ways as you read it. As i told 
                you in my prvious page that one of the problem i made some erong decisions was 
                because i listened to other people. I was not saying that you should totally 
                stop listening to other people. Listen to what they have to say and don't just 
                react befpre the end. It's not necessary to react in every situation. They sometime
                have useful information just remember the things which you think would be useful 
                for you in the coming future. This way you will gain knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also said that I didn't have any knowledge of the thing i have to do in my life.
                It was true and best way you can get out of that problem is simply by searching
                it online. In today's era we have the most powerful thing in our hand which is 
                internet. We are accesible to infinite knowledge and things in all over the world.
                All of this is only one click away so why not take the advantage of it. It's up to
                you that how you use your internet. Everything has pros & cons of its own it's up
                to us how we use it in our advantage. We have seen that many people just use internet 
                to look at reels and shows nothing else. I am not saying that don't do that but going
                overboard is not good for you. It's a addiction which is very hard to leave. I am not
                bluffing it took me a whole year to reduce the addiction of my phone. So i am speaking 
                with experience.

                As a teen i know what are the major problems in today's children no matter where they live.
                We all love to live a delusional life created by our own mind so that we can use it as a 
                excuse to escape the reality and face real problems in life. Some of us are very overconfident
                in our ability to do work which always reults in spoiling our work. We all teens tend to act
                like we are some kind of geniuses and never ask for help which is a major stepback. In order to grow 
                you have to accept your shortcomings and ask for help from someone who is expert in that field.
                We always think if we ask for somebody's help it will be a bad impression but people really 
                admire those who knows when to do their work and when to ask for help so they don't create
                any problems for others. Asking for help won't be a disgrace and a stain in your character,
                it rather improves your character and make you more approachable. So it's important for us to
                leave our delusional world and face the reality of the world because sometimes it can be too late
                just because of your delusions,overconfidence and arrogance.

            <h2><b>The best thing you can do for your self growth is to surround yourself with people of same goal.
                It would be in you best if you have people with same goals around you and positive people. You don't 
                want someone who is easily discouraged or is lazy at the work. If you have that kind of person in 
                your group you only have 2 choices either you leave him where he is now or if he want to grow take 
                him with you and help him grow himself. Just remember that if you help other's in their worst they 
                will also help you to go through your difficult life phases. As i also don't posses much experience
                this is the only thing i could tell you. I hope you enjoyed reading it and can help this to improve 
                yourself.
